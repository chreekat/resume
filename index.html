<section class="execSummary">
  I am interested in roles where I can be strategic and make use of my broad
  storehouse of thoughts and ideas. I think deeply, and intuitively come up with
  unique solutions to complex problems. I enjoy coming up with plans that I can
  share and discuss with colleagues. With my background, my talents are
  applicable to many activities in the software industry: building, prototyping,
  architecture, solutions engineering, technical project management, incident
  management, and leadership. I'm always curious to find more.

        Supported the <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell programming
        language</a> ecosystem as a member of the <a href=" ">GHC</a> compiler
        team and infrastructure working group.
      <li>
        Organizationally, I bridged disconnected teams with direct
        participation and weekly public reports. I also improved ecosystem
        resiliency and service continuity with better documentation and
        processes.
      <li>
        Technologically, I made several advances: (1) I built and operated a service
        that drastically improved CI for the compiler by mitigating spurious
        failures. Pipelines that needed to be manually restarted multiple times
        now finish reliably. (2) I built and operated deployment workflows for
        ecosystem services such as <a href="https://stackage.org">Stackage</a>.
        (3) I indepedently planned and executed service migrations for various
        critical services.
